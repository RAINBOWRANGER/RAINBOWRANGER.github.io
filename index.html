<p>My name is Will Farrell and I am currently attending RIT. I attended 4 different high schools so I am not going to list them. In my freetime I am usually reading comics or playing videogames, I don't really watch a lot of tv but I like to watch movies with friends. Thank you for reading through this little intro paragraph.</p>
